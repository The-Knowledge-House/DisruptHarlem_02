    <p class="about_para"> I am writing to let you know about my writing abilities as a student of your class. And also, throw light on how my writing skills have developed within a period of time. As a native of Ghana, Twi has been my local dialect. My country, like many others, has variety of languages. In addition to my initial language (Twi), I speak Ga and a few more dialects, which do not come out fluently  when spoken. In school, I learned how to read and write in French. Spanish also is one of the classes I am taking at the moment; so hopefully, it will emerge as one of my dialects too.  </p>
    <p class="about_para"> To be a great English essay writer has always been a beam of rays that reflects on my heart. Unfortunately, English essay writing was one of my weakness in middle school. For a bizarre reason, it always brought my grades down. I had to find means to work on that flaw of my education. I took advice from people who had broken that nut of their lives. My dad, my mentor, told me, "dedicate hours into reading novels and other educational materials”. What I made out of my dad's advice was to read more if I really wanted to improve on my awful situation in writing essay. I held onto that treasure. This tremendous advice putted a smile on my face as I was acknowledged a brilliant essay writer  in G.E.D class I went to. Mrs. Haynese was the last English teacher I had at the G.E.D site. She and other teachers were delighted to have a student like me</p>
    <p class="about_para">   I feel there is a river of satisfaction that flows from the heart, through the mind onto a paper, anytime I express myself when writing. This feeling pushes me to my feet to work harder and come out with better writings. As a chip from the old block, I put in my best when writing like my dad does, but I am not perfect. As human, I am affiliated with both major and minor grammatical errors. Mostly are as a result of not going through my writings. One of my weaknesses which I am working on is not building on my points and mixing up ideas. Often not making my work project the main idea which I want to address, and tends to either make the writing pointless or confuse the reader.</p>
    <p class="about_para">  My journey through Hostos College is built on a body of goals, but mainly, I want to come out with good grades so I can transfer to a different school to pursue Computer Science. Hostos has provided productive and interesting classes for my major - Liberal Arts. I consider English 110 one of them. Most of the questions I had were answered in class with the wonderful lecture we had. My only concern is about how this class would being out the best in me and contribute towards the flying colors I want. I witnessed how effectively the lesson went; I hope it continues in that route to make class livelier and a nice environment to learn. </p>
    <p class="about_para">  It is funny how this writing has turned out to throw more light on other issues about me. I feel by having opportunity to talk about my writing, it has given me the platform to express myself and to say more about me. I actually want to be a software engineer. I am ready to study hard and do anything that is educationally related, to achieve my goal. I love math in addition to writing,  but it is sad how it is also bringing my grades down lately for some novel reason. I hope I get better in it as I put effort like I have done for writing.</p>
