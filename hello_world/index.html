<h1> BLACK ECONOMIC UNITY </h2>
<p> If there is to be economic development in the Black community, then the community must hold on to the dollar, turn it over so that the dollar is used two, three or more times in the spending and income cycles of the community. In short, the community must be a bucket that can hold water, not a bucket where the water runs out as fast as it is poured in.
